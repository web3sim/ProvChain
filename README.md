# ProvChain - Verifiable Data Provenance for AI & Enterprises


**Tagline:** "Trust Every Byte — Provable Data Provenance for AI & Enterprises."

## 🚀 Project Overview

ProvChain is a revolutionary knowledge graph database built on Filecoin that provides cryptographically verifiable data provenance for AI systems and enterprises. Unlike traditional databases that store data without proof of integrity, ProvChain links every node and edge in the knowledge graph to Content-Addressed Storage (CID) and Proof of Data Possession (PDP) mechanisms.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Verifiable Knowledge Graph**: Every node and edge cryptographically linked to immutable storage
- **Real-time Provenance**: Complete audit trail from data source to query result
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated SOX, GDPR, HIPAA compliance reporting
- **AI Integration**: Native LangChain connectors for verified AI pipelines
- **Pay-per-Proof**: Cost-effective verification billing model

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Data Sources → ProvChain Core → Applications
     ↓              ↓              ↑
WarmStorage ← Filecoin Network → FilCDN
```
